Build a fully animated, futuristic, high-tech astrology website named “Astrocharm”. 
The design should look premium, modern, 3D–inspired and visually stunning. 
Use Vite + React for frontend, Node + Express for backend. 

### UI/UX Requirements:
- Use a dark cosmic theme with neon gradients (purple/blue/gold).
- Add smooth parallax animations, glassmorphism cards, glowing borders, particle background effects, and soft 3D shadows.
- Homepage should feel high-tech like an AI dashboard + astrology fusion.
- Use Framer Motion for animations: fade-in, slide-up, zoom, staggered transitions.
- Use Lottie animations where needed (stars, zodiac wheel, loading effects).
- Navbar must be sticky, glassy, and animated.
- Buttons should glow on hover and have micro-interactions.
- Add a dynamic particle starfield background (canvas or tsParticles).
- Typography should feel premium — elegant serif + futuristic sans.

### Pages to Generate:
1. **Home Page**
   - Hero section with animated zodiac ring, tagline, and CTA buttons.
   - Floating cards for Kundli, Horoscope, Tarot, Matchmaking.
   - Animated astrologer carousel.
   - Parallax “Why Astrocharm?” section with icons that glow on hover.
   - Testimonials slider with smooth 3D transitions.

2. **Kundli Page**
   - Beautiful form with date/time/place inputs.
   - Animated moon/planet orbit illustration.
   - On submit → loading animation → show generated Kundli card UI.

3. **Horoscope Page**
   - 12 zodiac icons with hover animation.
   - Dynamic content section with fade/slide transitions.

4. **Astrologer Page**
   - Modern card grid with neon glow borders.

5. **About Page**

   - Galaxy-themed timeline.

### Component Requirements:
- Reusable components: AnimatedCard, GlowingButton, StarBackground, FloatingIcons.
- All components must be clean, modular and professional.

### Backend:
- Node + Express project.
- Route: POST /api/kundli → return mock Kundli JSON.
- Route: GET /api/horoscope/:sign → return mock horoscope text.
- Add CORS + rate limiting + logging middleware.

### Project Setup:
- Create a client/ and server/ folder.
- Use concurrently to run both.
- Add a clear README containing run instructions.
- Add .replit file to auto-run `npm run dev`.

### Design Goal:
Make the website look like:
- A futuristic AI-powered astrology system
- High-motion, premium-quality UI
- Clean, smooth and professional — like a top-level commercial product

Make all code production-ready and well-commented.
